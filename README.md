# Wireframe2Web: Automated Website Generation with Vertex AI's Gemini Models

Welcome to **Wireframe2Web**! This project leverages the power of Vertex AI's Generative AI models, specifically the Gemini series, to transform hand-drawn wireframes and text prompts into fully functional website code. Whether you're a designer, developer, or just curious about generative AI, this tool is designed to streamline the web development process and make your ideas a reality with ease.

## About the Project

In the realm of web development, converting design concepts into actual code can be a daunting task. **Wireframe2Web** simplifies this process by utilizing AI to generate HTML, CSS, and JavaScript directly from your wireframe sketches and optional textual prompts. The application is built using Flask, a lightweight Python web framework, and interacts with Vertex AI's Generative Models service to deliver quick and efficient results.

## Features

- **Upload Hand-Drawn Wireframes:** Convert your sketches into website code effortlessly.
- **Model Selection:** Choose from a variety of pre-trained Gemini models tailored to different design styles.
- **Prompt Integration:** Guide the AI with optional text prompts for more customized results.
- **Code Generation:** Instantly generate clean, ready-to-use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** An intuitive web app interface that simplifies the entire process.

## How It Works

1. **Upload a Wireframe:** Start by uploading an image of your hand-drawn wireframe.
2. **Select a Model:** Pick a Gemini model that suits your design style.
3. **Add a Prompt (Optional):** Provide a brief text prompt to influence the design.
4. **Generate Code:** The AI processes the input and generates the corresponding website code.
5. **View the Result:** The generated code is displayed, ready to be copied or downloaded.
